# Word-Guess-Game
Word guess game, ala Hangman
This version of hangman offers the user four categories to select from and the program decides the secret word. The user types to find the secret word. Won or lose, the game initializes the screen and the user selects a category. After winning or losing, a user is alerted if they try to type without selecting a category to generate a new secret word. 
A future update may allow the user to try again with the same word. 

A brief sound file affirms whether they won or lost. As they select wrong characters a scaffold comes to life and a body begans to form, along with messages to the user. Once the body is fully formed, the game is lost. The thumbs up/down icons keep score. Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery all played a role.
