# Word-Guess-Game
Word guess game, ala Hangman
This version of hangman offers the user four categories to select from and the program decides the secret word. The user types to find the secret word. After a game is won or lost, the characters entered by the user are removed, the image is updated, and some variables are reset. The user is alerted if they try to type without having selecting a category to generate a new secret word. The display does not indicate when there is more than one word, i.e., the space is treated as a character and an underscore appears in its place. The user only types letters and not the space band.

A brief sound file affirms whether they won or lost. As they select wrong characters a scaffold comes to life and a body begans to form, along with messages to the user. Once the body is fully formed, the game is lost. The thumbs up/down icons keep score. Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery all played a role. 

Note: A future update may allow the user to try again solving the same secret word if they have lost.
